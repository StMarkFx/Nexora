# deepseek.py
# This file is a placeholder since DeepSeek R1 1.5B is managed locally via Ollama.
# If this were a traditional setup, this file would contain code to load the DeepSeek model.

# Example of what would be here if we were loading the model directly:
# from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
#
# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("deepseek-r1-1.5b")
# tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-r1-1.5b")
#
# def generate_response(prompt):
#     inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
#     outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
#     return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Since we're using Ollama, the model is managed externally.
# Refer to the Ollama documentation for more details: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama
